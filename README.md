# Identity Game

A futuristic, astronomical-themed web game that asks you 10 questions and tries to determine your identity using AI logic.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML file
- `main.css` — Stylesheet (blue, purple, yellow, astronomical/futuristic theme)
- `main.js` — Game logic
- `assets/` — Images, fonts, and sounds for the game
    - `assets/images/` — Image assets
    - `assets/fonts/` — Custom fonts
    - `assets/sounds/` — Sound effects or music

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step is required.

## Customization

- Add your own images, fonts, or sounds to the `assets/` directories as needed.
- Edit `main.js` to change questions or add AI integration.
